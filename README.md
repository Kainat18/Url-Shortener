# URL Shortener Project

## Intro
The URL Shortener Project is a web application designed to shorten long URLs into more concise and shareable links. It provides users with a convenient way to generate short links for easy sharing on various platforms.

##  üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: `React.js`
- **Styling**: `CSS`
- **State Management**: `React Hooks (useState, useEffect)`
- **API Integration**: `Fetch API` for interacting with the URL shortening service
- **Notifications**: `React-Toastify` for displaying user notifications


## üöÄ Features
- Shorten long URLs into compact links.
- Copy shortened URLs to the clipboard with a single click.
- Save and manage shortened URLs locally using browser storage.
- View previously saved URLs in the history section.
- Clear saved URLs from the history.

## üìù Process
- **Getting Started:** The project began with thorough research into URL shortening techniques and available APIs. Initial planning involved outlining project requirements, selecting appropriate technologies, and setting up the development environment.
- **Experience:** Developing the URL shortener project provided me with a valuable hands-on experience in frontend development using React.js. Exploring various libraries and tools, such as React-Toastify for notifications, enriched the development process.
- **Struggles:** Challenges were encountered during API integration and handling asynchronous operations, particularly in managing state updates and displaying loading indicators. 
- **Conclusion:** Despite the challenges, completing the project was a rewarding experience. Overcoming obstacles led to a deeper understanding of React.js concepts and frontend development best practices. 

## Learnings
- Gain proficiency in React.js and React Hooks for frontend development.
